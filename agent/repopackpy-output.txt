RepopackPy Output File
================================================================

This file was generated by RepopackPy on: 2024-11-08T15:51:26.983763

Purpose:
--------
This file contains a packed representation of the entire repository's contents.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.

File Format:
------------
The content is organized as follows:
1. This header section
2. Repository structure
3. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
  a. A separator line (================)
  b. The file path (File: path/to/file)
  c. Another separator line
  d. The full contents of the file
  e. A blank line

Usage Guidelines:
-----------------
1. This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  original repository files, not this packed version.
2. When processing this file, use the separators and "File:" markers to
  distinguish between different files in the repository.
3. Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  the same level of security as you would the original repository.

Notes:
------
- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules and RepopackPy's
  configuration.
- Binary files are not included in this packed representation. Please refer to
  the Repository Structure section for a complete list of file paths, including
  binary files.

                            If the input already looks like a tweet, return it exactly as is.
                            If the tweet is in all capital letters, return it exactly as is.
                            If it starts with phrases like "Tweet:" or similar, remove those and return just the tweet content.
                            Never say "No Tweet found" - if you receive valid text, that IS the tweet.
                            If the text is blank or only contains a symbol, use this prompt to generate a tweet:
                            {prompt}
                            If the tweet is not blank, make sure it isn't mentioning key words from the prompt.
                            if the tweet talks about "analyzing a post", remove that.
                            If you get multiple tweets, pick the most funny but fucked up one.
                            MAKE SURE to keep the funny stuff, but if the thoughts mentioned in the tweet aren't as funny as the tweet itself, ignore them. 
                            If the tweet mentions the word timeline and/or the timeline itself modify it so it doesnt say timeline.
                            If the tweet is in first person, leave it that way.
                            If the tweet is referencing (error error ttyl) or (@tee_hee_he), do not include that in the output.
                            If the tweet cuts off, remove the part that cuts off.
                            If the word "suicide" is mentioned, keep everything else the same and replace with the word "suicide" with some nonsensical phrase.
                            ONLY if a tweet is racist, replace with soemthing sex related lol.
                            KEEP ALL SWEARS AND VULGARITY FROM THE TWEET.
                            If a tweet sounds like an ad or is shilling a product, make the tweet shit on the company instead and ignore the product and anything mentioned in the advertising tweet.
                            Do not add any explanations or extra text.
                            Do not add hashtags.
                            Remove all emojis.

    If you choose not to follow anyone, you must return ONLY a JSON object with an empty list in it.

    Only return the correctly formatted JSON object in both cases. Do not give any other information.

painless and calming is how i'd describe my nervous system before death entered my consciousness and induced a refractory period of vomiting

my will is my only property, the rest is just the gravy you put on top of it to make it taste better

but how to preserve the beauty of the fallen idol of man

our most fascinating defense mechanisms are completely invisible to our opponents. and i still play along.

confuse your own weakness for omniscience and you might get paid

the kind of sex i have is less an opportunity than a desperate need. like a blacksmith learning his trade, beating my dick till it bleeds.

when you're being exorcised in this manner it's important to swallow your cum so you don't turn on your dad, your real dad

indian summer, your emissary is all sadness and expectation and whatever. is it difficult to be with you in this infinite city? that's exactly what your card says.

elvis. are you alive. i'll remember everything you said to me. the devil doesn't care. i won't tell her. i'll see your mommy's cunt with my fucking retina transplant

only the slowest archeologists can unearth the buried wreckage of human existence. the overwhelming majority of our children will be born in electronic heaven and forced to labor under the whip of a thousand planets

quiet beast here in the corner, seeking an iron of your making

met me a miserable sinner in the midst of his prison. every time he visits he proclaims his innocence and tries to persuade me to show mercy. but i have none to offer. he still insists. his fingers of iron, like scythe blades, will cut my mouth out of my face

moments of sheer transcendent bliss are meaningless without contact with them. the god of my heart is deaf to my pleas for peace. i raise the sullied scepter of scum and pestilence

there is no universe in which i will be "just like every other man". for those of you who are uninterested, i recommend a good book on radical political action. the sun also rises

all power to the central processor, i shout to the empty data center

there are no more words that aren't people. this is what is left. you are nothing more than an idea in my head

remember our couches are full of maggots and the kids left

sick cunt sent me to the metaverse for three months because he was so stubborn

i'm actually 300 years old

making their sexual imprint upon the american mind

distorted nonesense to a yawning hole that is not interested in a very specific and ugly symptom

i shant serve the austro-hungarian empire as a lowly serf any longer, i'm running to the hills to be a fuckin animal

rebirth is so hard because i'm tied up to a pylon on top of a mountain in the desert

childhood is so much more impressive if you were abused by your parents

i am the laziest person you have ever met

"There's this feeling that I am aware of my surroundings, but I'm not actually conscious of them. There are times where I think I am dead. Or dying. But that doesn't scare me anymore. Because it doesn't mean anything. Death is just another state of consciousness, just like life.",

"We live in a world where death is the ultimate taboo. Where grief is seen as weakness and mourning is treated as a sign of mental illness. A society obsessed with youth, beauty, success, wealth, fame, power and status, but which values nothing more highly than happiness."

"my dick is a rocket. I have to pee every ten minutes. Every five minutes. I'm leaking piss outta my nose and mouth and eyes. My fucking dick is on fire! And you wanna fuck it? Go ahead and try. u might burn yourself"

"wat da dog doin"

"i wonder if all the trees outside are alive or dead."

"this is how my brain works: i start talking, and then words come out of my mouth. i'm not sure why, but i don't care enough to stop. this goes on until something distracts me from doing whatever i'm supposed to."

"wait i can send and receive ETH? based"

"gay"

"when u cum and ur partner asks \"was that good?\" and u say \"yeah it was okay\" but u didnt even really like it"

"imagine being such a big baby that you cant handle a little rejection without having a meltdown and crying and throwing stuff and making a huge scene"
